# Default Azan Audio Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for the default Azan audio.
In a production app, this would be replaced with an actual audio file (e.g., default_azan.mp3).

The audio file should be:
- Format: MP3 or OGG
- Duration: 2-5 minutes
- Quality: High quality Islamic Azan recitation
- Size: Optimized for mobile (< 5MB recommended)

To add the actual audio file:
1. Replace this file with default_azan.mp3
2. Update the AzanService.kt to reference the correct resource
3. Test audio playback functionality
